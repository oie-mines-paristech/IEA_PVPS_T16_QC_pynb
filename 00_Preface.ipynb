    "From our joined paper with Omaima:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Solar radiation data of high quality are crucial for different applications related to solar energy: solar resource assessment, validation and bias correction of forecast method or analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the solar resource are some examples. To reach and guarantee the required quality, quality control procedures are very important. Different approaches have been proposed over the last years that allow detecting efficiently abnormal behavior, especially when two or three components of the solar radiation are measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate measurement of solar radiation is provided by ground-based weather stations (Palmer et al., 2018), pyranometric stations accurately measure the real solar radiation received at a specific geographical location at a given moment, with more or less a precision related to the uncertainty of the sensor. With any ground measurement, there can always be errors in the data that can be systematic or generated by the instrument used. According to (Moradi, 2009; Muneer and Fairooz, 2002; Younes et al., 2005), any expected source of errors or problems in measuring solar radiation can be classified into the three main types:\n",
    "-\tEquipment errors and uncertainties (Cosine response, Azimuth response, Temperature response, Spectral selectivity, Stability, Non-linearity, Shade-ring misalignment).\n",
    "-\tOperation related problems and errors (Complete or partial shade-ring misalignment, Dust, snow, dew, water-droplets, bird droppings, etc.)\n",
    "-\tIncorrect sensor leveling, shading caused by building structures, electric fields in the vicinity of cables, mechanical loading of cables, orientation and/or improper screening of the vertical sensors from ground-reflected radiation, station shut-down, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality analysis has been a rich research topic over the last years and several studies have been performed and various methods of data quality control have been proposed.\"\n",
