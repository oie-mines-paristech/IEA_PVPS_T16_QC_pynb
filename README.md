## Table of Contents

[**Preface**](00_Preface.ipynb)
 
This notebook presents the motivation behind writing the notebook. 
Installation of libraries used throughout this notebook.
     
[**Chapter 1: Description of the netcdf dataformat used for the solar radiation measurements**](01_netcdf_format.ipynb)
     
In this chapter we provide a description of the structure of the netcdf used to store solar data. The data are uploaded in this format on a Thredds Data SErver (TDS), whose functionalities are exploited in the later part of this notebook.
     
    *Further work on the data format are needed to include detailed metada*

[**Chapter 2: Accessing solar measurements**]02_netcdf_format.ipynb)

How to access to solar measurements using a Thredds Data Server.

     * we need a solution to handle the usr/pwd or change the dataset into an open source one *

[**Chapter 3: Quality control**](03_SolarDataQC.ipynb)

Demonstrates example of good practices for preparing the data and conducting the most important QC procedures.

[**Chapter 4: Validation of a single satellite product at a single station**](04_ValidationCAMSRad.ipynb)

Example of validation routine for the CAMS Rad data.
     
     * we should find an alternative to using Alexander's mail to access CAMSRAD *
