    "\"Solar radiation data of high quality are crucial for different applications related to solar energy: solar resource assessment, validation and bias correction of forecast method or analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the solar resource are some examples. To reach and guarantee the required quality, quality control procedures are very important. Different approaches have been proposed over the last years that allow detecting efficiently abnormal behavior, especially when two or three components of the solar radiation are measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate measurement of solar radiation is provided by ground-based weather stations (Palmer et al., 2018), pyranometric stations accurately measure the real solar radiation received at a specific geographical location at a given moment, with more or less a precision related to the sensor's uncertainty. With any ground measurement, there can always be errors in the data that can be systematic or generated by the instrument used. According to (Moradi, 2009; Muneer and Fairooz, 2002; Younes et al., 2005), any expected source of errors or problems in measuring solar radiation can be classified into the three main types:\n",
    "-\tEquipment errors and uncertainties (Cosine response, Azimuth response, Temperature response, Spectral selectivity, Stability, Non-linearity, Shade-ring misalignment).\n",
    "-\tOperation related problems and errors (Complete or partial shade-ring misalignment, Dust, snow, dew, water-droplets, bird droppings, etc.)\n",
    "-\tIncorrect sensor leveling, shading caused by building structures, electric fields in the vicinity of cables, mechanical loading of cables, orientation and/or improper screening of the vertical sensors from ground-reflected radiation, station shut-down, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality analysis has been a rich research topic over the last years and several studies have been performed and various methods of data quality control have been proposed.\"\n",

    "To demonstrate our recommandations on data preprocessing and quality control, we decided to use 1-min solar raidation measurements from the BSRN network (https://bsrn.awi.de/). This dataset encompasses among other variables high quality measurements of the three components of the solar radiation for a set of stations worldwide.

    "https://bsrn.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bsrn.awi.de/Publications/BSRN_recommended_QC_tests_V2.pdf\n",
    "This first quality control consists in a set of two tests for each physical quantity: the physically possible limit and the extremely rare limit tests. These are detailed for the GHI, the DHI and the BNI below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physically Possible Limits (PPL)** check the maximum and minimum limits that can be reached by irradiance, the upper limits depend on the solar zenith angle, the minimal value of solar irradiance must be 0 W/m², but because of the radiative cooling at night the limit is set at -4 w/m2, the test applies independently to each of the three components as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-4 \\leq GHI \\leq 1.5 \\, I_{0} \\, cos(SZA)^{1.2}+100$\n",
    "\n",
    "$-4 \\leq DHI \\leq 0.95 \\, I_{0} \\, cos(SZA)^{1.2} +50 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$-4 \\leq DNI \\leq  I_{0} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The limits of the **\"Extremely Rare Limits\"(ERL)** procedure are more strict than those of the \"Physically Possible\" test. ERL differs from the PPL test in that the measurements rarely reach these limits, and even if the case is only for short periods of a few seconds to one or two minutes, and also in those measurements violating these limits are not necessarily incorrect but their plausibility should be checked more specifically. The ERL limits are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-2 \\leq GHI \\leq 1.2 \\, I_{0} \\, cos(SZA)^{1.2}+50$\n",
    "\n",
    "$-2 \\leq DHI \\leq 0.75 \\, I_{0} \\, cos(SZA)^{1.2} +30 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$-2 \\leq DNI \\leq  0.95 \\, cos(SZA)^{0.2} + 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of test allows flagging each value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical representation of these two tests is possible by representing the 10-minute averages of GHI, DHI or DNI as a function of the irradiance received at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). This representation is shown in Fig. 7 where the one-component PPL and ERL tests are represented by green and red lines respectively.\n",
    "In view of the QC equations, it might have been simpler to use the cosine of the zenith solar angle for the graphical representation of the QC. However, we opted for the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere because we judged this quantity to be more intuitive. Finally, another quantity would have been more suitable to represent the quality control of the DNI but we chose to keep the same quantity between the different representations for consistency reasons.\n",

    "Another two-component test set often used is the \"K value\" test proposed by NREL (SERIS QC), which operates in a dimensionless space, with solar irradiance normalized to extraterrestrial values.\n",
    "The exact upper limits for GHI and DHI are difficult to define, especially under unstable conditions with clouds, smokes or aerosols where diffuse radiation may exceed the maximum limits, leading to an increase in GHI that may in these cases exceed top atmospheric radiation or where clouds are at an elevation that allows direct radiation to rise for a brief time period, for this purpose another set of tests based on transmittances calculations is often used also, the test includes a check of diffuse horizontal transmittance and the beam transmittance as a function of the global horizontal transmittance or clearness index. These different indices are at the origin of the test's name. \n",
    "The transmittances are calculated from the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the direct beam transmittance: $K_{n}=DNI/I_{0}$\n",
    "* the diffuse transmittance: $K_{d}=DHI/GHI$\n",
    "* the global horizontal transmittance (clearness index): $K_{T}=GHI/TOA$\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist very elaborate versions of this test, such as the one proposed by NREL, which is adaptive (Maxwell et al., 1993). In our study, we will limit the focus to simpler versions the test by using the limits proposed by (Norbert Geuder et al., 2015) described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two tests to qualify \"K-values\": a first plausibility check in the $K_{T}-K_{n}$ space and a second in the $K_{T}-K_{d}$ space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tests performed in the $K_{T}-K_{n}$ space are:\n",
    " * $K_{n}>K_{T}$\n",
    " * $K_{n}<0.8$\n",
    " * $K_{T}<1$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the qualification of measurements in the $K_{T}-K_{d}$ space, the following checks are performed:\n",
    "* $K_{d}<1.05$ for $SZA<75°$\n",
    "* $K_{d}<1.1$ for $SZA>75°$\n",
    "* $K_{d}<0.95$ for $K_{T}>0.6$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two tests being included in the two-component test of BSRN, we only consider the limit of 1.1 for $K_{d}$ and won't differentiate according to the SZA here.\n",
    " \n",
    "To visualize the different tests, the measurements are shown in the $K_{T}-K_{n}$ and $K_{T}-K_{d}$ spaces in the plots below. The limits specified for the different tests are represented by dotted red lines.\n",

For this, we can note that the three-component test consists in comparing the GHI measured with the pyranometer with an estimate of the GHI obtained with the DNI measured with a pherilyometer and the DHI measured with a shaded pyranometer using the equation linking the GHI with two other components and the zenith solar angle . Ideally, the ratio of measured and estimated GHI should be 1.0, but instruments characteristics often produce values far from unity.\n"
